# Heading one

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you
all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any
annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## heading two

They come with all sorts of predesigned components like buttons, cards, and
alerts that might help you move quickly at first, but cause more pain than they
cure when it comes time to make your site stand out with a custom design.

Tailwind is different.

Instead of opinionated predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level
utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever
leaving your HTML.
