# Tech Stack For A Blog

Continuing from
"[should developers build their own blog?](/blog/should-developers-build-their-own-blog)",
here are a more technical breakdown of the main technologies I've decided to use
to build my blog

- Markdown/MDX
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Markdown/MDX

Markdown focuses on the **content**. You can learn it in
[60 seconds](https://commonmark.org/help/), and start formatting text with
simple markups like # for headers, \* for bold or \_ for italics and the text
will get rendered on the page as corresponding HTML elements. It's popular among
developers because it's easier to write than HTML and more expressive than pure
text.

Take the following Markdown text

```md
## This is a Markdown heading

And the content can be **bold** or _italics_
```

And it will be compiled down to HTML as

```html
<h2>This is a Markdown heading</h2>
<p>And the content can be <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italics</em></p>
```

**MDX**

And for React developers, they can even extend Markdown's simplicity with the
power of JSX. In other words, in the same file, we can use Markdown for the
content and use React/JSX components for any other use cases.

An example could be integrating a calendar component in between Markdown text

```md
## Book appointment

<ReactCalendarComponent />

**How does the booking process work?**
```

Whereas the typical React/JSX code of the above snippet would look like

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Book appointment</h2>
      <ReactCalendarComponent />
      <strong>How does the booking process work?</strong>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how much cleaner and fast it is to write in MDX?

**How does MDX actually work?**

So if MDX can do the job for React/JSX, Markdown and HTML, how does it actually
work? Is it a new text format like Markdown or it is something else magical?

Luckily Cole Bemis already answered this question for us in his
[excellent talk](https://egghead.io/talks/mdx-demystifying-mdx), so I'd highly
recommend people who have questions to give it a watch.

To summarise:

> MDX (the library), at its core, is a function and accepts a MDX string and
> returns a JSX string.

And you can visualise the process from MDX to HTML as so

## Next.js

There are many production-ready
[static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) to choose from, but
the two popular choices in the JavaScript/React ecosystem are Next.js and
Gatsby. I've briefly mentioned them in
"[should developers build their own blog?](/blog/should-developers-build-their-own-blog)",
and here I'll summarise the reasons why I picked Next.js

**Server differences**

As of version 10, Next supports the following development paradigms:

- Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Client Side Rendering (classic use of React)

Gatsby supports the above three paradigms too, but its SSR approach is slightly
different than Next. A typical server-side rendering creates the HTML file at
_run time_ (when the server receives request), but Gatsby creates the HTML file
at _build time_ (when source files are being compiled).

Another example of how Gatsby server works differently is reading local files.
In Gatsby, you'll need to install plugins like `gatsby-source-filesystem` but
with Next you can just use the native Node.js modules `fs`.

**Simpler API**

Currently, you'll only need to learn two API methods for SSG in Next

- `getStaticProps` - get page **content** from external data
- `getStaticPaths` - get page **paths** from external data

> External data can be data from local files, databases or third-party services
> like Firebase/Airtable/Contentful.

Whereas in Gatsby, the
[lifecycle APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-lifecycle-apis/) for data
sources are more complex and often requires its own plugin (e.g
`gatsby-source-filesystem` or `gatsby-source-contentful`), configurations (e.g
`gatsby-config.js`) and GraphQL.

**What would make me choose Gatsby?**

Gatsby shines with its extensive plugin ecosystem (currently
[2000+](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/), ranging from JSON transformer,
analytics to Shopify integration), this could be a big time saver when compared
to Next.

Gatsby is also opinionated about using GraphQL as its default data fetching
strategy, whereas in Next you are flexible to pick your own data fetching
solution and GraphQL is only one of its many supported options.

GraphQL may be overkill for smaller projects, but once the project exceeds
certain complexities, the benefits of adopting GraphQL are significant. GraphQL
can fetch only the data we need (not whatever an API returns), perform useful
data transformations (e.g from date string to formatted string), define schemas
and more. In the future, if I wanted to learn GraphQL or have a project with
complex requirements, I would pick Gatsby over Next.

## Tailwind CSS

There are many ways of adding styles to React components, we could use pre-made
component libraries such as Ant Design or Chakra UI to kick start the project
quickly, or make our own components and add styles with utility-class libraries
like Tachyons or Tailwind CSS.

**Just the "CSS"**

While component libraries can offer us polished components like card, dropdown
or even layouts out of the box, we often find ourselves fighting their defaults
or customising behaviours on top of theirs. I picked Tailwind because I wanted
to write my own components and just want to have a low level library to help me
design faster.

_why don't I use another utility library or just write vanilla css instead?_

When compared to other utility libraries or writing vanilla CSS, Tailwind offers
the following advantages:

- Tailwind has done the hardest part for you - the namings!
- Tailwind has great defaults (responsive, pseudo-class, built in design
  principles)
- Tailwind has a great developer experience (editor intergrations, great
  documentation site with plenty resources, a community of developers/designers)
- Popularity (over 2 millions downloads per month) and constantly being updated,
  it is argubly the most popular utility library to use today
- Premium [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) components for an even faster
  development experience

**Markup**

People will often point out that Tailwind markups can get out of control and
does not follow the "seperation of concerns" paradigm

```jsx
// button.jsx
function Button() {
  return (
    // This many class names just for one button? ðŸ˜±
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Button
    </button>
  );
}
```

That is one way of using Tailwind, but if you want a more component-based
approach like React, you can extract out any repetitive styles into their own
classes in a seperate file

```css
/* button.css */
@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }

  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
  }
  .btn-blue:hover {
    @apply bg-blue-700;
  }
}
```

> The `@layer` is a Tailwind directive, it is being used to instruct Tailwind to
> consider those styles when purging (removal of un-used CSS from bundles)

And now the component looks like so

```jsx
// button.jsx
function Button() {
  return <button class="btn btn-blue">Button</button>;
}
```

To summarise, with Tailwind you can:

1. fast protyping with utility class names
2. extract common patterns into components when necessary
3. even publish your Tailwind components as
   [plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins), e.g
   [tailwindcss-dark-mode](https://github.com/ChanceArthur/tailwindcss-dark-mode)

## TypeScript

If you are a JavaScript developer (or not), you probably already heard of
TypeScript. In recent years, TypeScript has become a developer must-have, from
ranking 2nd most loved langauge in
[StackOverflow 2020 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
to being adopted as the main langauge for [Deno](https://deno.land/) (Node.js
creator's successor project), and there are good reasons for it. TypeScript
allows type checking in JavaScript, can compile to different targets like Babel,
focus on developer experiences and encourage for best practices like
auto-completion or linting and so much more.

For this project, I want to use TypeScript whenever possible. In fact, all the
technologies I've listed in this post either have first-class support for
TypeScript or are itself built with TypeScript.
